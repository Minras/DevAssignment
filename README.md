# Assignment explanation

This assignment is intended to test your knowledge. It's simple enough, but allows us here at Ratus to see
_how_ you tackle problems.

## Guidelines
* Supply an object oriented solution
* Don't forget to add docblocks
* You're not allowed to use external libraries
* Write your best, most beautiful code.
* Write your solutions in `application/src/Application/Main.php`
* You're allowed to add files. (Better yet, this is recommended)
* Start in `public/index.php`!
* You may use `var_dump(); ` to output the filtered data.
* The data you'll be working with is already being set on `Application\Main` for you.

## Summary
You're going to be filtering the data supplied to you from an array of random data.

You'll come across the following code in `public/index.php`: 

```php
/**
 * Assignment description here
 *
 * @todo implementation
 */
$application->yourMethodCall();
```

This has to be replaced with your method calls, and must accomplish what has been described in the docblock above it.
