# Assignment explanation

This assignment is intended to test your knowledge. It's simple enough, but allows us here at Ratus to see
_how_ you tackle problems.

## Guidelines
* Supply an object oriented solution
* Don't forget to add docblocks
* You're not allowed to use external libraries
* Write your best, most beautiful code.
* Write your solutions in `application/src/Application/Main.php`
* You're allowed to add files. (Better yet, this is recommended)
* Start in `public/index.php`!
* You may use ```php var_dump(); ``` to output the filtered data.

## Summary
You're going to be filtering the data supplied to you from an array of random data.

You'll come across the following code in `public/index.php`: ```php $application->yourMethodCall();```
This has to be replaced with your method calls.
